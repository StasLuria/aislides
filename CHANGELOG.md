### 🐛 Bug Fix: Pressing Enter with attached file does nothing ✅

- [x] File is shown as chip, text is entered, but pressing Enter/Send button does nothing
- [x] Root cause: stale closure in sendMessage — sessionId was null after createSession() because React state hadn't updated yet
- [x] Fix: added overrideSessionId parameter to sendMessage in useSSEChat, pass explicit session ID from handleSend and pendingMessageRef effect
- [x] Verified: file attach + send creates session, uploads file, sends message, AI responds correctly
- [x] 953 tests passing

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Chat resets to empty after sending message with attached file ✅

- [x] After uploading a file and sending a message, the chat resets to "Создайте презентацию"
- [x] The session is not saved — it disappears from the sidebar
- [x] Root cause: pendingMessageRef useEffect fires when sessionId changes (from navigate), but pendingMessageRef.current is still null because uploadFilesToSession hasn't finished yet
- [x] Fix: when files are attached, call sendMessage directly after file upload completes instead of relying on pendingMessageRef
- [x] 953 tests passing

### ✨ Paste-to-attach & File chips inside input area ✅

- [x] Add paste event handler (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V) on textarea to attach files from clipboard
- [x] Move attached file chips from separate area to inside the input container (above textarea)

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Chat UI doesn't update after sending message ✅

- [x] After sending first message, screen stays on empty "Создайте презентацию" instead of showing chat
- [x] SSE progress events not displayed in real-time — user must switch chats and back to see results
- [x] When presentation is ready, the "Посмотреть презентацию" button doesn't appear until chat is re-opened
- [x] Root cause: race condition between loadSession (useEffect on params.id) and sendMessage (pendingMessageRef)
- [x] loadSession called by useEffect after navigate("/chat/${newId}") wiped messages added by sendMessage
- [x] Fix: added justCreatedSessionRef flag — set before navigate, checked in useEffect to skip loadSession
- [x] 953 tests passing

### ✨ Custom Template Upload Feature ✅

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Empty 'Новый чат' sessions STILL being created (persistent) ✅

- [x] Previous fix was insufficient — sessions still appear on page load/navigation
- [x] Deep audit: find ALL code paths that call createSession or POST /sessions
- [x] Root cause: old orphan sessions (0 messages, idle phase) from before lazy-creation fix
- [x] Fix: Server-side filtering in GET /sessions — exclude sessions with 0 messages + idle phase
- [x] Fix: loadSession handles 404 by redirecting to /chat (deleted/missing sessions)
- [x] Deleted 3 remaining orphan sessions from DB
- [x] 937 tests passing

- [x] Verified: TXT upload → S3 → text extraction → ready status

### 🐛 Bug Fix: New empty chat sessions created repeatedly on every page load ✅

- [x] Root cause: ChatPage useEffect called createSession() on every /chat navigation (no ID)

- [x] Fix: Create session lazily on first message (pendingMessageRef pattern)
- [x] Fix: Added resetSession() to useSSEChat to clear state without DB call

- [x] Cleaned up 19 orphan empty sessions from DB
- [x] 914 tests passing

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Presentation generation hangs after selecting Quick mode ✅

- [x] Root cause: SSE connection drops due to proxy timeout (~60s) while generation takes 3-4 minutes
- [x] Generation actually completes on server, but client doesn't see the result
- [x] Fix: Added polling fallback in useSSEChat — when SSE drops during generation (progress > 0, no done event), polls session status every 5s
- [x] Fix: When polling detects phase change to "completed", reloads full session messages and shows result
- [x] Fix: loadSession auto-starts polling if session is in "generating" phase (handles page reload)
- [x] Fix: Added visual indicator "Соединение восстанавливается..." with amber pulse dot
- [x] Verified: generation completes on server, polling detects completion, 914 tests passing

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Viewer shows empty slides (URL not found) ✅

- [x] Root cause: chatOrchestrator didn't upload HTML to S3 (resultUrls was null)
- [x] Root cause: legacy presentations stored layout_id instead of layoutId
- [x] Fix: Added S3 HTML upload in chatOrchestrator for both quick and step-by-step modes

- [x] Fix: Background reassemble triggered to fix missing result_urls for future visits
- [x] Fix: Added normalizeSlides helper in slideEditRoutes to handle legacy layout_id → layoutId migration
- [x] Verified: K0mPVkDoWhkxYUnJ now renders correctly via fallback + reassemble

- [x] Mode buttons now shown in chat for user to click explicitly
- [x] Removed mode selection from settings panel (only theme + slide count remain)
- [x] Verified: phase stays mode_selection until user clicks a mode button

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Text messages during awaiting_approval treated as approval ✅

- [x] Fix chatOrchestrator: text messages in step_structure phase are now edit requests, not approval
- [x] Only the explicit "approve_structure" action button triggers generation
- [x] LLM modifies existing outline based on user feedback (using json_schema response_format)
- [x] Test: "удали последний слайд" → 12→11 slides, phase stays step_structure, buttons shown
- [x] 894 vitest tests passing
